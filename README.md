## XMAS Tree ##

xmas-tree is some code I knocked together based on the example that causes the tree to glimmer all over.

There are a number of different options; you can type the one you want at the command line, or, if omitted, the code will pick a new one at random every 60 seconds.

## Installation ##

Copy it to somewhere, and run it (duh). I had it in ```/usr/local/bin``` so that it was in the path, and then I added ```/usr/local/bin/xmas-tree &``` to ```/etc/rc.local``` on the pi zero.
